Purpose of the policy This policy outlines the guidelines to be followed by all PwC employees for claiming optional/flexible payroll components of their compensation (herein after referred to as 'Reimbursable Flexible Benefits' or 'RFB') Before submitting any claims under RFB, employees should check the authenticity of reimbursement claims and tax proof supporting documents. RFB is subject to the Income Tax Act and Income Tax Rules, therefore it is the duty and responsibility of employee to adhere to the compliances of the Income Tax Act and any related Acts and regulations. Any non-compliance or submission of false claim/wrong declaration would expose the employee to legal proceedings initiated by the regulatory authorities and may also result in strict disciplinary action being taken against them by PwC. Though these RFB claims are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC), it is necessary to follow certain guidelines to claim these expenses, so that PwC and its personnel are fully compliant with the extant laws and regulations in this regard. These expenses are part of PwC's Profit and Loss (P&L) statement and have to be supported in a similar manner as normal business expenditure. This policy and the limits of RFB can be changed at any time due to changes in law or at PwC's sole discretion. Further, PwC can at any time conduct audit of documents submitted by the employees and if any claims or accompanying proofs are inaccurate, fake, forged or inadequate, adequate action would be taken against them. 2. Applicability This policy is applicable to all the employees of PwC, including FTE employees availing the reduced hour's flexibility option, FTC and Trainees (P).

Purpose of the policy This policy outlines the guidelines to be followed by all PwC employees for claiming optional/flexible payroll components of their compensation (herein after referred to as 'Reimbursable Flexible Benefits' or 'RFB') Before submitting any claims under RFB, employees should check the authenticity of reimbursement claims and tax proof supporting documents. RFB is subject to the Income Tax Act and Income Tax Rules, therefore it is the duty and responsibility of employee to adhere to the compliances of the Income Tax Act and any related Acts and regulations. Any non-compliance or submission of false claim/wrong declaration would expose the employee to legal proceedings initiated by the regulatory authorities and may also result in strict disciplinary action being taken against them by PwC. Though these RFB claims are part of an employee's cost to company (CTC), it is necessary to follow certain guidelines to claim these expenses, so that PwC and its personnel are fully compliant with the extant laws and regulations in this regard. These expenses are part of PwC's Profit and Loss (P&L) statement and have to be supported in a similar manner as normal business expenditure. This policy and the limits of RFB can be changed at any time due to changes in law or at PwC's sole discretion. Further, PwC can at any time conduct audit of documents submitted by the employees and if any claims or accompanying proofs are inaccurate, fake, forged or inadequate, adequate action would be taken against them. 2. Applicability This policy is applicable to all the employees of PwC, including FTE employees availing the reduced hour's flexibility option, FTC and Trainees (P).
